== Name

git-gone - prune "gone" Git branches

== Synopsis

*git gone* [_-fv_] list +
*git gone* [_-fv_] prune

== Description

Lists or removes "gone" branches, that is, local branches which used to have an upstream branch on a remote which is now removed.

This situation typically occurs in a pull request workflow where the upstream branch gets deleted on the server after merging a pull request, leaving the local branch from which the pull request originated in place.
*git gone* easily removes these left-over branches.

== Commands

list::
    List all gone branches.

prune::
    Delete all gone branches.
+
Prints a list of deleted branches including a command to restore the branch as long as the referenced commit is still in the reflog.

== Options

-V::
--version::
    Print the version number and exit.

== Exit status

0 on success, non-zero otherwise.
